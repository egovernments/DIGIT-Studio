# 🏛️ Digit Solution Framework

A unified, configurable architecture to streamline service development and UI integration for government and urban governance projects. This framework enables teams to build scalable, reusable, and maintainable digital solutions by consolidating common services, UIs, and configurations.

---

## 📌 Overview

Government digital platforms often suffer from fragmented development efforts, leading to:

- 🚧 Inconsistent implementations across similar services  
- 🔁 Duplication of UI and logic, increasing maintenance overhead  
- 🔄 Limited reusability of components and features

The **Digit Solution Framework** addresses these challenges by offering:

- ✅ A shared service layer to standardize logic and reduce redundancy  
- ⚙️ Configurable, modular UI components to support rapid customization  
- 🛠️ A centralized management console for easier administration and control
